# DensityPath
A novel algorithm, DensityPath, which accurately and efficiently reconstructs the underlying cell developmental trajectories for large-scale scRNAseq data.

Cell fates are determined by transition-states which occur during complex biological processes such as proliferation and differentiation. The advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) provides the snapshots of single cell transcriptomes, offering the essential opportunity to study such complex biological processes. DensityPath, that can accurately and efficiently reconstruct the underlying cell developmental trajectories for large-scale scRNAseq data. DensityPath algorithm not only extract the separate high density representative cell states to handling the heterogeneous scRNAseq data accurately based on the powerful level-set cluster method, but also constructs cell state-transition path by finding the shortest paths (geodesic) of the representative cell states on the surface of density landscape.
